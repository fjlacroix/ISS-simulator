# ISS-simulator
Simulator for ISS and drone interactioné
This program simulates the orbits of the ISS and the drone satelite theorized by François-Joseph Lacroix. The drone follows the ISS around and provides images of the ISS live to the ground. Many paths are possible around the station, mainly ellipses, arches, sinuses, spirals, and many more. This program is intended to simulate orbits in 2D to provide a preliminary view of what the drone satelline would be capable of.
